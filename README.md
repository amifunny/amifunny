I am simple boy who got interested in programming and taught himself programming skills and continue to improve in that. I love the feeling of creating things and self-discovery.

Coding for 4 Years and creating stuff for 2 Years now.

**My Aim** - Not to waste a single day of this provided life. 
I achieve this by either learning stuff or creating stuff daily.

**Current Interests** -

 - Will be creating 3D Games using Unity.
 - Participating in any competition that encompasses my skill set.

	- [Scrape-Pad](https://github.com/amifunny/Scrape-Pad-Browser-Extension) : Quickly take down notes and create document.
- [Piano-Synth](https://github.com/amifunny/Piano-Synth) - Virtual Piano with Deep Learning assist to create music.
- [Recommendation System](https://github.com/amifunny/likely) - SVD, KNN, and Bandits for Movie recommendation
- [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/amifunny/Reinforce_Adventure) - Popular Algorithms of RL implementated in GYM
- [Deep Learning](https://github.com/amifunny/Deep-Learning-Notebook) - I love DL. I won't call it reasearch but I do tweaking and experimenting with Neural Networks.

**My Story** : -

 - Learned **C++** in my highschool for 2 years. Loved it and also excelled in its exam.
 - But still wanted to create applications that were fun use and create.
 - So learned **Java** from CS106a on YouTube. Loved Prof. Mehran Sahmi style of teaching. Completed all assignments.
 - Used *Head First Android development*Book  to learn **Android Studio** and created some projects.
 - Took a offline course on web development, learnt **PHP, Javacript,HTML/CSS**.
 - I stumbled upon CS50. It uplifted my knowledge and quality of projects. Learnt **Flask** which i began to use in every project.
 - Took **Deep Learning** Coursera Specialization by Andrew Ng, **Reinforcement Learning** Specialization on Coursera.
 - Buzz and appreciation about **React** took me to it and loved it.
 - I considered **game development** challenging so i took the challenge and started using PyGame.

So this was my story which will continue, I don't know why but.. yeah I wrote it.

**I am now looking for professional work oppurtunities.**
