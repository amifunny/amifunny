Hey, :partly_sunny:

<img align="center" src="readme.JPG" />

I am a self-taught programmer, which means I am not taught by few handful of teachers in a class but thousands of people situated all around the world.

I continue to improve upon my programming skills. I love the feeling of creating things and self-discovery.

**My Aim :dart:** - Not to waste a single day of this provided life.

I achieve this by either learning stuff or creating stuff daily.

**Current Interests :rocket:** -

 - Will be creating 3D Games using Unity.
 - Participating in any competition that encompasses my skill set.

**Open-Source Projects** - 

 - [tf-stitch](https://github.com/amifunny/tf-stitch) -  Pip Package to quick start deep learning projects.
 - Chrome-Extensions -
	 - [Dark-Mode-Chrome](https://github.com/amifunny/Dark_Mode_Chrome) : Makes reading easy in dark on any website.
	- [Scrape-Pad](https://github.com/amifunny/Scrape-Pad-Browser-Extension) : Quickly take down notes and create a document.
- [Piano-Synth](https://github.com/amifunny/Piano-Synth) - Virtual Piano with Deep Learning assist to create music.
- [Recommendation System](https://github.com/amifunny/likely) - SVD, KNN, and Bandits for Movie recommendation
- [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/amifunny/Reinforce_Adventure) - Popular Algorithms of RL implemented in GYM
- [Deep Learning](https://github.com/amifunny/Deep-Learning-Notebook) - I love DL. I won't call it research but I do tweaking and experimenting with Neural Networks.
